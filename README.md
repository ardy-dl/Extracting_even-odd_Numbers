# Extracting_even-odd_Numbers
File Handling Exercise
###### Instructions: Write a Python program that reads a text file named numbers.txt that contains 20 integers. The program will create two other text file; the first text file will be named even.txt that will contains all even numbers extracted from the numbers.txt. The second text file will be named odd.txt that will contains all odd numbers extracted from the numbers.txt.
## How it works?
- There are three .txt files, one for reference that will serve as the read file and the other two will be an output file and will be appended.
- even.txt will display all the even numbers from the reference file
- odd.txt will display all the odd numbers from the reference file
## How to use?
1. open a txt file that consists of numbers specifically integers, this will serve as the reference file.
2. Run the code and wait for the files to display the extracted numbers and separate them into even or odd.
